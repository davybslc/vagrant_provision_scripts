These scripts are written for VirtualBox base box containing:
  * Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit

See <http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes/base.html> and <http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/virtualbox/boxes.html>for more info about base box configuration.  [This](https://github.com/fespinoza/checklist_and_guides/wiki/Creating-a-vagrant-base-box-for-ubuntu-12.04-32bit-server) guide was also helpful
